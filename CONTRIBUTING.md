# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions in any form from opening and working on issues in the issue tracker to contributing to the code and documentation directly.

If you would like to contribute, please start by opening an issue within the relevant repo so we know what you're working on. We will also use the opened issue to work through if your approach is correct and ensure no one else is already working on the same issue.

If you have direct repo access, please note that we develop on a fork-and-PR model - be sure to fork the repo, contribute on a branch under your own fork, then open a PR against the appropriate branch under the origin repo (typically `main`).

If you have further questions about contributing, please reach out to a maintainer directly before starting work.

## Style Guide (code)

1. Utilize UTF-8
2. User modular architecture to group similar functions, classes, etc. 
3. Always use 4 spaces for indentation (don't use tabs)
4. Try to limit line length to 80 characters
5. Follow the standard set by the language in regard to capitalization of classes, functions, etc.
6. Where otherwise not specified and where language standards aren't clear, use camel case for class names and leave function names in lowercase separating words with _ for clarity.
7. For all parts of the project, look at the existing style and adhere accordingly
